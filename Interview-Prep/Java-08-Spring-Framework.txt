Preparing for Spring Framework(Backend Development):

Spring MVC : There are four layers in the Spring MVC

1. Controller Layer:
	- Use: Receives and processes user requests, interacts with the Model layer, and selects the appropriate view to render the response.
	
2. Service Layer:
	- Use: Contains business logic and acts as an intermediary between the Controller and the Data access layer, 
	facilitating reusable and modular code.
	
3. Repository (Data Access) Layer:
	- Use: Manages data persistence and retrieval, interacts with databases or other data sources, providing an abstraction for the underlying storage.
	
4. Model layer:
	- Use: Represents the application's data and business logic, ensuring a clean sepration form the presentation and control layers for enhanced
	maintainability.
