Eureka Server or Eureka Discovery:


Eureka service registers all the information about other services so that one service can find another service easily.

Imagine service discovery as a game of hide-and-seek.

Each player(service) hides in a differnt room (server), and Eureka is like the referee who keeps track of where everyone is hiding.
So, when one player needs to find another, they just ask the referee, and they point them in the right direction, 
making it easy to find each other and continue playing together.

Eureka server provides:

1. Service Registration: Services register themselves with Eureka server.

2. Service Discovery: Services find and locate each other thourgh Eureka.

3. Health Monitoring: Eureka monitors the health of registerd services.
